Ambani later enrolled for anMBAatStanford University(whereSteve Ballmerwas his classmate[25]) but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.[23]His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.[19]
Ambani was influenced by his teachersWilliam F. SharpeandMan Mohan Sharmabecause they are "the kind of professors who made you think out of the box."[23]
Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (laterReliance Communications Limited), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives.[26]At the age of 24, Ambani was given charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the company was heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals.[27]
Ambani directed and led the creation of the world's largest grassroots petroleum refinery inJamnagar, India, which could produce 660,000 barrels per day (33 million tonnes per year) in 2010, integrated with petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related infrastructure.[28]In December 2013, Ambani announced the possibility of a "collaborative venture" with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for the 4G network in India.[29]On 18 June 2014, Ambani said he will invest Rs 1.8 trillion (short scale) across businesses in the next three years and launch 4G broadband services in 2015.[30]
In February 2014, aFirst Information Report(FIR) alleging criminal offences was filed against Ambani for alleged irregularities in the pricing of natural gas from theKG basin.[31]
